# Description
We are making an Arduino RC car. We are taking what we created last term and massively improving it. My role in this project is to design and create the steering mechanism, gearbox and differential rear wheel drive. Lewis' role is to program the motors and Elisha has control of all the circuitry.

I have gone over the design for many components a number of times, I have finalised all these but I think there will be changes later down, especially with the gearbox.
